My name is Suhas. I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineer with a tremedous amount of interest in Computer Vision, and by extension Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality and all their relatives. On the other hand I'm also drawn to art, animation, web design etc.

Someday I want to be part of making all of our Sci-Fi movies a reality! :sunglasses:  
And this blog is just a way to show what I do in my free time.
